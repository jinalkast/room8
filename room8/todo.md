- To test cleanliness manager, had people sit in front of computer, and receive 5 sets of before and after images and see how they use the application

Bugs and Testing

[ ] cant create bill anymore
[ ] make bill preset font the same as rest
[ ] move chore presets to the top of the modal window, keep "chore presets" font and space below the same as rest of input fields
[ ] when inviting a user, if the email does not correspond to a user it should return the error "this user does not exist on the app!"
