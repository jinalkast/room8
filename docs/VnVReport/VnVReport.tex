\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}\\
\textbf{FR211} - Change description to use Google account instead of using name, email and password.\\
\textbf{FST-UAHM-1} - See above description. \\
\textbf{FST-UAHM-2} - Change input field of test case to using Google account instead of email and password. \\
\textbf{FST-CM-1} - Changed description to remove cleanliness score and add listing objects chaged. \\
\textbf{FR232} - Removing because of it is no longer part of the implementation scope. \\

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
