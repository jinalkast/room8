\nsection{G.1 Context and overall objective}
%---------------------------------
\begin{flushleft}
Shared living environments often create tension between roommates. It is usually cumbersome to reach out to a roommate about messes they left behind in a shared space, concerns over bill payments, household upkeep, and more. Our project, Room8, aims to prevent these cumbersome interactions by providing an application and the necessary hardware components to help monitor the cleanliness of shared spaces, schedule tasks, track shared billing cycles, and alert roommates of any issues within the shared house.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{goal}\label{goal:first}
Create a system that monitors the cleanliness of a shared living space, such as a kitchen or a living room.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:second}
Provide roommates with a centralized platform to manage, schedule, and task household tasks.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:third}
Provide roommates with a centralized platform to manage, schedule, and track bill payments.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:fourth}
Alert and remind roommates of issues regarding issues related to the shared living spaces, reducing tension between each other.
\end{goal}

\nsection{G.2 Current situation}
%---------------------------------
\begin{flushleft}
Room8 is designed to reduce points of tension and reduce the need for frustrating dialogue commonplace with people in shared housing, especially students. Currently, in order to manage the many shared responsibilities, roommates have to utilize multiple techniques or tools such as physical calendars, notification reminders, and existing applications such as Splitwise which do not have any integrations between each other. Additionally, it is estimated that approximately 25\% students experience conflicts with a roommate, harming academic performance and inducing stress [1]. Recognizing these factors, Room8 aims to create a centralized platform that not only simplifies communication but reduces stress and conflict to improve the lives of students. 
\end{flushleft}

\nsection{G.3 Expected benefits}
%---------------------------------
\begin{flushleft}
As stated in section G.2, conflicts between roommates create more than issues in the home and involve more than just misunderstandings in scheduling tasks or living standards. By creating a centralized suite that will help roommates monitor, schedule, and coordinate, Room8 will reduce conflicts between roommates over misunderstandings and miscommunications, and allow for greater flexibility in assigning responsibilities. Additionally, reduced conflicts will lead to mental health benefits for those living in the home by lowering conflict-related stress.  Finally, Room8 is expected to improve academic performance in some students who are hindered academically by conflicts with roommates (approximately 17\% of students [1]). 

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
An improvement in response times amongst roommates over household concerns.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
Increased flexibility in task scheduling and management, due to the presence of a centralized application.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
Improved communication and transparency over household matters between roommates.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
A reduction of events in which a roommate forgets or neglects their responsibilities to the home.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
Improved household cleanliness and upkeep.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
A reduction in conflicts between roommates over household matters.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
A reduction in stress for roommates due to reduced conflicts amongst each other.\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
Improved mental health for students who experience conflicts with roommates.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
An improvement in academic performance for students experience stress caused by issues with roommates.
\end{benefit}

\end{flushleft}

\nsection{G.4 Functionality overview}

\nsection{G.7 Stakeholders and requirements sources}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Stakeholder} & \textbf{Category} \\ \hline
Students              & Direct  \\ \hline
Landlords and Residence Assistants         & Indirect \\ \hline
University Housing Committee & Indirect \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Stakeholders and Categories}
\end{table}

\nsubsection{G.7.1 Direct Stakeholders}
\textbf{Students Off Campus} \\ Students off campus are the primary direct stakeholders for Room8. They are the main users of the mobile application who create houses within the app and set up the camera systems. These students seek to maintain cleanliness in their shared living spaces and establish accountability when a mess is left behind by a roommate. The application addresses common challenges faced by students in shared living arrangements, such as maintaining cleanliness, splitting expenses, and scheduling activities. \\
\\
\textbf{Students On Campus} \\ Students on campus are the other direct stakeholders for Room8. They are the main mainly concerned with the chore and activity scheduling aspect of the app. In most cases students living on campus do not have a kitchen and individuals are responsible for keeping their own rooms clean so these types of students would benefit from scheduling the cleaning of public spaces (eg. pool table, game space) and seeing events that are happening.

\nsubsection{G.7.2 Indirect Stakeholders}
\textbf{Landlords} \\ Landlords are the main indirect stakeholders to the project. Landlords are renting out their homes to students and are concerned with the condition their house is kept in. They are looking to maintain the clean condition of their home which is done by holding students accountable for messes that are made.\\
\\
\textbf{Residence Assistants} \\ Resident assistants are another indirect stakeholder who would benefit from Room8 specifically the activity scheduling feature. Resident assistants are responsible for hosting events for students living on campus and Room8 provides a calendar system to make events on a shared calendar to inform students of any upcoming activities.\\
\\
\textbf{University Housing Committee} \\ The University Housing Committee is another key indirect stakeholder in the project. These committees often seek to help students transition into living in shared spaces and provide guidance and support. Room8 offers a wide range of services that address common points of frustration faced by students, which are often brought up to these university committees. By facilitating better communication and organization, Room8 helps enhance the overall living experience for students.

It helps ensure the secure handling of personal information.\newline

    \item \textbf{CASL (Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation):} A Canadian law aimed at regulating commercial electronic messages, including emails and texts, to prevent spam. It requires consent before sending such communications, ensuring transparency and privacy.\newline

    \item \textbf{"Before" Picture:} The image of the shared living space before a student enters and uses it.\newline

    \item \textbf{"After" Picture:} he image of the shared living space after a student uses it.\newline

    \item \textbf{Cleanliness Tasks:} A list assigned to a user after they have finished using the shared living space and have assigned themselves or been assigned by another user. It is derived from an algorithm in which the inputs are a "before" and "after" picture pair.\newline

    \item \textbf{OAuth 2.0:} An open standard protocol for authorization, allowing secure access to user data across different services without revealing login credentials. OAuth is commonly used to enable single sign-on or to grant third-party applications limited access to a user's resources.\newline

    \item \textbf{PPM (Pixels Per Metre):} A measurement used to define the resolution of digital images, specifically indicating the number of pixels within a meter of space. It is often used in imaging, mapping, and display technologies to describe the level of detail or clarity in an image.\newline

    \item \textbf{FoV (Field of View):} In digital images, FoV refers to the extent of the observable area at any given moment. It is the angle/ scope that the camera sees.\newline

    \item \textbf{UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):} A time standard used globally to regulate clocks and time.

\end{flushleft}


\nsection{E.2 Components}
This section outlines the relevant external components that the system will interact with. These include existing systems or services, particularly software, that will provide or consume APIs. These interactions play a significant role in how the system operates within its broader ecosystem, impacting design and integration.
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Motion-activated camera:} Room8 will be connected to a camera that is activated by motion in the shared space. This component is used for taking a “before” and “after” picture that serves as the input for the cleanliness detection model. \newline
  
  \item \textbf{Object detector API:} Room8 will utilize an object detector that performs on a pair of images (i.e. the “before” and “after” picture) taken by the motion-activated camera. Object detection enables the algorithm to quantify the difference in room states as a function of objects and their transformations.\newline 
  
  \item \textbf{Household items dataset:} The ML model will be pre-trained with a dataset containing common household and kitchen items. This will allow the object detector to classify the items it detects and is important for providing valuable output to students.\newline
   
  \item \textbf{Google calendar API:} Room8 will interface with Google calendar to facilitate scheduling chores and events. This is critical for Room8's chore scheduling.\newline

  \item \textbf{SMS ChatBot:} The application employs a ChatBot to send notifications to students via SMS about their responsibilities in the home (i.e. cleaning their mess from shared spaces, upcoming chore deadlines, and money owed for shared bills). This helps with bookkeeping, enforcing fairness, and keeping shared spaces clean.\newline

  \item \textbf{OAuth 2.0:} The app utilizes the OAuth 2.0 protocol to manage user authentication and authorization securely. OAuth 2.0 allows Room8 to provide a seamless login experience using third-party identity providers without requiring users to create and manage separate credentials. OAuth 2.0 handles the app’s legal and privacy compliance standards.\newline
  

\end{flushleft}

\nsection{E.3 Constraints}
Constraints are non-negotiable limitations imposed on the system, stemming from external factors such as business rules or technical requirements. These restrictions must be strictly adhered to during development. Constraints can influence system design and implementation, and their fulfillment is critical to ensuring the system meets its operational requirements.
%---------------------------------
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Camera resolution:} The resolution of the motion-activated camera affects the quality of the input that is used by the object detector. Depending on the PPM of the image, there is a minimum viable object size for a given object to be classified.\newline
  
  \item \textbf{Platform compatibility:} The application must be compatible on Android and iOS to accommodate all users in the home.\newline 
  
  \item \textbf{Data privacy compliance:} The application adheres to all applicable data privacy regulations for the region in which it operates. User data must be handled with the utmost care and cannot be shared or used without explicit consent. Prior to collecting, storing, or processing any personal data, the appropriate permissions must always be obtained to ensure compliance with privacy laws and to respect user rights. \newline

\end{flushleft}
%---------------------------------


\nsection{E.4 Assumptions}
Assumptions are conditions that are presumed to be true during development to simplify system design. These are not externally enforced but are accepted for the sake of convenience or efficiency. While helpful, assumptions must be carefully evaluated, as changes in the assumed conditions could affect the system’s success or performance.
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Network connectivity:} The application assumes that there is reliable internet connection. Operating under this assumption, the camera is able to transfer images to the detector and students have access to updated synchronized information when using the app.\newline

  \item \textbf{Operating system support:} The application is compatible with the versions of Android and iOS that are currently supported by mobile providers.\newline
  
  \item \textbf{Common household items dataset:} The classifier can assume that any object it comes across is a common household item that belongs to a class represented in its training data.\newline 

  \item \textbf{FoV of the camera:} The camera is stationary and the FoV is identical in any pair of “before” and “after” images.\newline

\end{flushleft}
\nsection{E.5 Effects}
This section describes how the system’s operations will influence its environment. These effects could be on processes, workflows, or other systems that interact with the system. Understanding these impacts is crucial to ensure that the system's operation aligns well with its intended environment and does not cause unintended disruptions.
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Digital minimalism:} Students part of a home cab conduct all interactions on one platform. All common virtual services are provided by the Room8 application, hence eliminating the need for other applications that clutter the digital space.\newline

  \item \textbf{Accountability:} Room8 promotes social responsibility and user accountability by assessing the cleanliness state of the room before/after use and quantifying the difference in the 2 states, providing a cleanliness task list. Students are given objective feedback and all students in the home are held accountable for their actions.\newline
  
  \item \textbf{Ease social tension:} Students living in a home can feel tense about confronting their roommates when asking them to clean up, pay them back, or do the chores they agreed to. The ChatBot sends reminders about these duties, taking the pressure off students to confront each other and risk compromising their relationships.\newline 
\end{flushleft}

\nsection{E.6 Invariants}
Invariants are properties of the environment that the system must maintain throughout its operation. These are foundational conditions that must hold true at all times during system activities. Ensuring that these invariants remain intact is essential for the correct and safe functioning of the system within its environment.
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Limited camera presence:} The motion-activated camera is initially triggered by motion, and takes a “before” picture. When motion has not been detected for a prolonged and predefined amount of time, it takes an “after” picture. These 2 images aside, the camera does not take any pictures or footage and thus does not have any insight on the activities occurring in the environment.  
  \newline
  \item \textbf{Students' freedom to not comply:} While the application sends reminders to students for them to pay their debts or clean up their messes, it cannot enforce these events. Room8 serves as a logistical coordinator but it cannot have a direct impact on the physical environment.
  \newline

  	\item \textbf{1.4 - Schedule Configuration:} Users are able to configure details related to the scheduler within this view. Options to add/remove chores (including assigned users) and events (booked spaces) are found here.
  	\item \textbf{1.5 - Bill Splitter Configuration:} The area of the application where users can input and view details regarding shared expenses. Includes configuration to add/remove/edit bills and which users to split with, as well as outstanding balances and history of balances paid. Additionally, users can manually "settle" their outstanding payments by confirming that they've been paid within this interface.
  	\end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{2. Back-End Cluster}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{2.1 - Auth and House Management Logic:} The logic for authentication and user/house details are housed here. Any updating of information (as per user request) will be carried out in this component. Authentication (through OAuth) will also be the responsibility of this software.
  	\item \textbf{2.2 - SMS ChatBot:} Responsible for sending out ChatBot messages to home group chats including reminders to complete tasks, notification of cleanliness assessment, expenses due from bill splitter, or update to configuration of user/home. Has the most dependencies with other back-end components since updates in those components will drive the output of new messages from the bot.
  	\item \textbf{2.3 - Cleanliness Calculator:} Runs the algorithm to determine which changes have been made in the shared space by the identified user. Receives input from the hardware (dependenciy) and returns changes to the GUI after each event.
  	\item \textbf{2.4 - Schedule Generator:} Houses logic that deals with the scheduling aspect of the application. Generates events to be displayed to each users calendar based on whether or not they're included in a chore or event.
  	\item \textbf{2.5 - Bill Split Calculator:} Calculation of charges due for shared expenses is done within this component. It will also keep track of which expenses are due by each user and who they owe, along with a history of charges paid.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{3. Hardware Cluster}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item \textbf{3.1 - Camera + Sensors:} All hardware used for the cleanliness calculation. Includes sensors to detect when a user enters or exits the shared space. Takes images which are sufficient quality for detecting the changes that a user makes within the space.

\nsection{P.5 Required technology elements}

\textbf{Camera} \\
A camera is used for the systems cleanliness detection aspect. A camera takes pictures for comparing the state of the shared space.\\
\\
\textbf{Motion Sensor}\\
A sensor is also used for the systems cleanliness detection aspect. The sensor detects movement which will work in unison with the camera to take pictures of the shared space.\\
\\
\textbf{Third Party Calendar API}\\
Room8's scheduler requires a calendar component where user's can book and view events and chores in a calendar. Implementing a calendar API from scratch can prove difficult and there are already many existing solutions.\\
\\
\textbf{Secure Database}\\
Users create accounts for Room8 where user and home information is stored on a secure database where sensitive information such as credentials are stored and individuals are able to change and delete accounts.\\
\\
\textbf{Third Party OAuth Service}\\
Users will sign in securely without risk of data leaks and malicious connections.\\
\\
\textbf{SMS Message Service}\\
Room8's ChatBot SMS will send messages to users using a third party messaging system that has connection to the Room8 application to send warnings and information of shared space.\\


\nsection{P.6 Risks and mitigation analysis}

\textbf{Machine Learning Model Training}\\
Finding enough data to train the machine learning algorithm to detect when a mess has been made and what detect what is altered or added in the space. Sensitivity to slight changes such as lighting is another risk with the machine learning algorithm approach. An alternative to adapt this scenario would be to use image differencing to detect changes in environment.\\
\\
\textbf{User Identification}\\
Being able to detect which user is using the shared space through the camera is a major risk. The program may not be supplied with enough information to identity which user is currently using the space. In order to work around this the program could get individuals to submit to the application that they are now using the space.\\
\\
\textbf{Scope Creep}\\
Unclear requirements and adding too many elements to the scope of the project will result in not delivering on features that are listed to be part of the application and lower quality of core functionality due to time being strain. A revisal of requirements by making requirements and functionality of system clear and concise and developing a prioritization list would mitigate the risk of scope creep.


\nsection{P.7 Requirements process and report}
\textbf{Requirements Elicitation}\\
For the elicitation of our requirements, we were able to discuss with our peers, who live in shared living situations, and took inspiration from our own experience as students who also have the need for an application like Room8.\\
\\
\textbf{Requirements Analysis}\\
The analysis of the requirements was completed as part of the problem statement and goals. As a group, we took the goals that we created in that part of the project and extracted them as functional requirements. Additionally, there were non-functional requirements that were mistakenly added as goals in revision 0 of that document, which gave us a basis for the specification.\\
\\\\\\
\textbf{Requirements Specification}\\
Evidently, the requirements specification are described in our Software Requirements Specification (this document itself). They will remain as the project continues and will be updated accordingly. \\
\\
\textbf{Requirements Validation}\\
The requirements validation will take place at two different stages of the project. First, they will be validated at the point of the PoC demo, where we will determine if the scope of the project is appropriate and we can pivot (add/reduce requirements) at that point. Furthermore, the final requirements will be assessed when the project is complete and demonstrated at the end of the Winter semester.\\
\\
\textbf{Requirements Management}\\
As previously mentioned, additional requirements will be made as necessary in this document and appended iteratively.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  

% \input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?} \\
When writing this deliverable the formatting of the document went smoothly. With the example texts and functions made intially on the example .tex document we were able to format the document to the requirements given to ensure a readable document. Also, the sectioning and table of content makes the document easy to navigate and the sections are ordered in a way that makes sense. This way when looking for a section in the requirement it is easy to find. Seeing as this is a cruicial document which will be referred to multiple times throughout the project, the setup, and readability of the document is integral.
  \item \textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them?}\\
A major pain point of this deliverable was we did not know which SRS format to use as there were three different ones given. Initially we went with the SRS with no label (scientific computation) but then realized after checking lecture slides this was the wrong one. We then had to start over using the proper template. This caused us to fall behind schedule.
  \item \textbf{How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?}\\
Almost half of our requirements were inspired by talking to peers and just personal experience from each of us. We fall under the group of stakeholders (students living off campus) and we choose to make this project from scratch because we have experienced the pain points covered in the requirements much like how our peers have as well. We did this through casual conversation with our classmates and friends alike.
  \item \textbf{Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.}\\
A course all of us have taken is SFWRENG 3RA3 Software Requirements course which is meant exactly for this deliverable. It went over key software requirement document components and helped us form this document. Another course that will help later down the line is COMPSCI 3ML3 which 4 of the 5 group members are taking. This will help in developing and learning about the machine learning algorithm.
  \item \textbf{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.}\\
There are about 4 key concepts the team will collectively need to acquire in order to successfully complete the project. The first is knowledge of machine learning. This will help us train the model and learn how the algorithm will work. Another is software testing because this will help us test the system and see if it's working correctly and properly under edge cases. Data privacy is also important for our project because without protecting user information the project will not be viable.
  \item \textbf{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}\\
For all knowledge areas listed above, there are courses available at McMaster to learn these skills. However, because we can not take all these courses because of elective restrictions, there are textbooks and online texts and videos available covering these topics. This will be the go to for most group members however some group memebrs already have experience and knowledge in these domains whether its from previous work experiences or courses taken. We will teach each other and learn together and take advantage of each others strengths to ensure progress in each field.
