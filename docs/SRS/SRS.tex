\comment{Goals are "needs of the target organization, which the system will address". While the development team is the principal user of the other books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all stakeholders.}

\nsection{G.1 Context and overall objective}
\comment{High-level view of the project: organizational context and reason for building a system.} 
%---------------------------------
\notEmpty{}
%---------------------------------

\begin{goal}\label{goal:first}
This is a goal example. If you need explicit (and automatic) numbering, you can use the definitions in the \texttt{.tex} template.
Is is refined by \ref{req:memo}
\end{goal}

\begin{req}\label{req:cross}
This is a requirement example. It illustrates how numbering is continuous and cross-types (if this is what you need).
\end{req}
    
\nsection{G.2 Current situation}
\comment{Current state of processes to be addressed by the project and the resulting system.}

\begin{req}\label{req:memo}
This is a requirement example. 
It refines \ref{goal:first}
\end{req}
    
\nsection{G.3 Expected benefits}
\comment{New processes, or improvement to existing processes, made possible by the projectâ€™s results.}
%---------------------------------
\notEmpty{}
%---------------------------------

\nsection{G.4 Functionality overview}
\comment{Overview of the functions (behavior) of the system. Principal properties only (details are in the System book).}

\nsection{G.5 High-level usage scenarios}
\comment{Fundamental usage paths through the system.}


\nsection{G.6 Limitations and exclusions}
\comment{Aspects that the system need not address.}
Below is a list of limitations and exclusions the system will not address:
\begin{limitation}\label{limitation:first}
System will not track activity completed by the user in the shared environment.
\end{limitation}
\begin{exclusion}\label{exclusion:first}
System will not request or send money directly to users in the bill splitting functionality.
\end{exclusion}
\begin{exclusion}\label{exclusion:second}
System will not use images taken to train machine learning model.
\end{exclusion}

\nsection{G.7 Stakeholders and requirements sources}
\comment{Groups of people who can affect the project or be affected by it, and other places to consider for information about the project and system.}

\textbf{Stakeholder} & \textbf{Category} \\ \hline

University Housing and Social Committee & Indirect \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Stakeholders and Categories}
\end{table}

\nsubsection{G.7.1 Direct Stakeholders}
\textbf{Students} \\ Students are the primary direct stakeholders for Room8. They are the main users of the mobile application who create houses within the app and set up the camera systems. These students seek to maintain cleanliness in their shared living spaces and establish accountability when a mess is left behind by a roommate. The application addresses common challenges faced by students in shared living arrangements, such as maintaining cleanliness, splitting expenses, and scheduling activities. 

\nsubsection{G.7.1 Indirect Stakeholders}
\textbf{Home Managers} \\ Home managers are indirect stakeholders to the project. Home managers includes landlords renting out their homes to students or residence assistants managing a room of students. The home managers look to maintain the clean condition of the shared space which is done by holding students accountable for messes that are made. 
\\
\\
\textbf{University Housing and Social Committee} \\ The University Housing and Social Committee is another key indirect stakeholder in the project. These committees often seek to help students transition into living in shared spaces and provide guidance and support. Room8 offers a wide range of services that address common points of frustration faced by students, which are often brought up to these university committees. By facilitating better communication and organization, Room8 helps enhance the overall living experience for students.

graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them?
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
