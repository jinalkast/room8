\section{Introduction}

Room8 is a suite of tools aimed at reducing the occurrence of frustrating situations between roommates. Room8 is expected to be implemented as a mobile application and interact with the physical world using a camera and as a result, is expected to handle sensitive user data such as addresses, names, birthdays, images, and financial details. As a result, the application can pose potential hazards to users with a hazard defined as any property or state of the system that could cause our users harm. This document aims to outline the scope, critical assumptions, potential failures, and mitigation strategies for Room8 in order to allow the development to design mitigations for these hazards.


\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of this document is to identify and mitigate losses that can be incurred from system hazards. There are multiple ways to mitigate the losses, such as following appropriate regulations, implementing thorough testing, and informing users how to properly use the system. By examining as many scenarios as possible where the system can cause harm and recording it in this document, the development team aims to minimize the harm exposed to users, stakeholders, and the development team. Possible losses that can occur from hazards include financial loss, loss of reputation, and service disruptions.      

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
This section goes over the components that the system can be divided into.

\subsection{User Device}
Smart phone the user is using with the supported version of Android or iOS.

\subsection{Camera}
Responsible for taking picture for cleanliness detection analysis when sensor sends information of user.

\subsection{Motion Sensor}
Detects movement in the shared space to determine if user has entered or exited shared space signaling the camera for a picture.

\subsection{User-Facing Application}
A mobile application installed on smart phones which have versions of Android and iOS that is currently being supported mobile providers. This includes front-end of the system where users can see details and change settings of various back-end components listed below.

\subsection{Authentication}
Authentication using OAuth of user credentials and house details are processed in this component including the update of information mentioned previously.

\subsection{SMS ChatBot}
ChatBot responsible for sending messages to group chat of home members for notifying them of cleanliness assessment, expenses from bill splitter, or reminders to complete tasks.

\subsection{Calendar Tool}
Allows users to add events to calendar and display to other housemates, if involved in event, in their respective calendars. Also houses logic for generating chore/cleaning schedule and adding in calendars of users.

\subsection{Cleanliness Manager}
Runs algorithm for detecting change in environment through input received from hardware and stores user's information for the user to view on application along with history of cleanliness.

\subsection{Bill Splitter}
Calculate charges due from a shared expense and keeps track of which expenses are due from each user and who they owe using the SMS ChatBot to notify users. Also stores history of expenses and charges paid for user to view.

\subsection{Database}
Used to securely store user and house information, calendar events, expense history, and pictures for cleanliness calculator.


\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CA1}: Homes will have a consistent and uninterrupted supply of electricity available.
\item \textbf{CA2}: Homes will have internet speeds capable of streaming video.
\item \textbf{CA3}: Every resident of a shared home will have their own personal electronic device.
\item \textbf{CA4}: Users have used other applications before and are familiar with common signifiers, mappings, and UI metaphores (ex. Heart implies like).
\item \textbf{CA5}: External services, such as location services, map integrations, and calendar APIs will be available and reliable.
\item \textbf{CA6}: Users' devices will have additional free storage beyond the what's required for the applications install.
\end{itemize}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

The following lists new requirements which will be added to the Software Requirements Specification Document.

\subsection{Safety and Security Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}1. ]
    \item The system will not show images of other users in the frame without proper sensoring.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To maintain user privacy and comfort. 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}2. ]
    \item The system will perform regular hardware tests.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To ensure hardware components are operating as expected.
\end{enumerate}  
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}3. ]
    \item The system deny suspicious login and password recovery attempts. This includes logins from drastically different geolocations or repeated login attempts.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To maintain a users' account security. 
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}4. ]
    \item The system will implement a minimum password strength criteria.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To maintain a users' account security. 
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}5. ]
    \item The system will hash and salt all confidential user data.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To maintain users' data privacy. 
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}6. ]
    \item The system will allow users to recover their password using their email.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To allow users access to their account in case they forget their password. 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}7. ]
    \item The system will lock the calendar resource when a user is scheduling an event.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To prevent scheduling conflicts with other users.
\end{enumerate}  
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}8. ]
    \item The system will use cloud storage with high-availability and auto-scaling capabilities to ensure continuous access to data.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To minimize downtime and allow users uninterrupted access to information by using the redundancy and high availability support provided by cloud infrastructure. Cloud storage also provides many benefits such as automatic scaling and monitoring. 
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}[{SR}9. ]
    \item The system will encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To protect sensitive user information from unauthorized access and ensure compliance with data security standards.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Access Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{AR}1. ]
    \item The system will implement optimal index using database index advisors to ensure data retrieval times do not exceed 3 seconds under normal load.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To improve user experience and ensure timely access to stored information.
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}[{AR}2. ]
    \item The system will enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users with access to sensitive information. \\
    \textbf{Rationale}: To prevent unauthorized access by adding an extra layer of security to sensitive data access from developers.
\end{enumerate} 

\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}1. ]
    \item The system will send clear images of the shared space.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: It is important the images are not hindered by objects covering majority of the share space. 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}2. ]
    \item The system will take pictures of the space at regular intervals so long as motion is not being detected.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: This will allow the system to have a series of images over various lighting and atmospheric changes. Bad input into the cleanliness detection algorithm is mitigated, since an improper (e.g. noisy, obstructed) picture at time of movement can be swapped with a good picture that represents the same cleanliness state.
\end{enumerate}  
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}3. ]
    \item The system will retry to upload images when network connectivity is restored if it has failed has failed due to connectivity issues.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: The cleanliness management system is one of our core features, to make the system more robust to periods of time when the network shutdown it should attempt to retry so an event that happens when there's no internet is still captured. 
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}4. ]
    \item The system will notify users if there has been no camera activity for an extended period of time.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}: The system is expected to be set up in a high traffic area, prone to frequent use. A lack of activity in that area would be unusual and could imply the system isn't working properly.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}5. ]
    \item The system will implement data integrity checks during data writing operations to verify successful storage.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}:  To ensure that user data remains uncorrupted and reliable for future retrieval. System will also be able to alert users if data is corrupted or if the action has failed, reducing confusion and frustration.
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}6. ]
    \item The system will monitor storage capacity in real-time and alert administrators when usage exceeds 80\% of total storage capacity.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}:  To prevent system slowdowns and failure to store new data by ensuring storage capacity is sufficient before reaching limit thresholds.
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{enumerate}[{IR}7. ]
    \item The system will perform data validation checks during data retrieval to verify the completeness and correctness of requested information.\\
    \textbf{Rationale}:  To ensure users receive accurate and complete data, maintaining trust in the system. System will also be able to alert users if data is missing or incorrect, reducing confusion and frustration.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Roadmap}

The hazard analysis has led to identifying essential safety, security, access, and integrity requirements to mitigate the possible risks in our system. The current focus will be on implementing core requirements which prevent major issues down the line as well as foundational tasks of the application that are harder to change in later stages of development. These include tasks such as data encryption, secure authentication, and high-availability and reliability cloud storage. In the next stage of development, feature component hazards will be tackled, such as safeguards for the calendar tool, cleanliness manager, and the bill splitter. Due to time constraints, certain non-critical requirements may not be fully implemented within the project timeline. For instance, more advanced cloud storage auto-scaling and redundancy configurations may be considered for future releases, whereas industry standard defaults will be used in the initial development stages. Towards the end of the project, the hazard analysis will be revisited to assess which risks have been effectively mitigated and identify any remaining vulnerabilities that require attention in future iterations.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item While writing this deliverable, the team had a relatively difficult time constructing the FEMA table. Referring back to previous documents, such as the SRS and the Development Plan, made it easy to extract the core design functions of our application and start evaluating the associated hazards. Another thing that had gone well when writing this deliverable was the discovery of new requirements/tests for the sake of minimizing requirements. An example of this is the cleanliness management system, we determine that the recommended action for ensuring no false positives and negatives is to create a set of test cases. Finally, we think a good thing that came out of this deliverable was that we realized we had missed a lot of requirements from our SRS, and we're expecting to use what we learned from this document to revise it.
    
    \item The most prominent pain point when writing this deliverable was that we had difficulty dividing the work and working in parallel. This document is a lot shorter than the SRS, and in this deliverable, each section was a lot more dependent on its previous sections. When it was time to work on the deliverable, the team got caught up with other obligations, leading to less time to work on this than we would have liked. Combining this fact with the fact that some people had to wait for others in order to finalize their sections led to a time crunch.\newline Another pain point was the flexibility in formatting our document compared to the SRS. The SRS was more structured than this document, and we knew exactly how to format our deliverable, as there wasn't freedom to alter it. This deliverable gave the group a lot more freedom in formatting some sections, which led to inconsistencies when working on the deliverable. These inconsistencies required group discussions as we needed to agree on a style, and then we had to revise our document to ensure it was cohesive and consistent. 
    
    \item The risks related obstructions related to the camera as well as false positives, negatives, and misclassification of cleanliness changes had been discussed before. These risks were discovered by our supervisor Dr. Ratnasingham (Thamas) Tharmarasa, who challenged many of our ideas when we were initially pitching the project and had asked us questions which made us realize we had made too many assumptions about our environment. Some other risks, particularly involving bad actors accessing user accounts, had been discussed before this deliverable, but only in passing when some implementation ideas were discussed as a group in an informal setting. The other risks had all come about naturally by simply trying to ask ourselves, "What could happen?" and "If this did happen, what could go wrong?".
    
    \item Other risks in software products include data privacy risks and security risks. Data privacy risks refer to risks that arise when a software product handles users' personal data poorly, leading to potential data leaks. Data privacy is arguably the most important requirement when designing a software system that accesses sensitive user data. If you mishandle a user's private information, the developer of the software is liable for the damage caused, which could be very severe depending on the type of data stolen. Not only will mishandling user data lead to a severe loss in user trust, but failing to comply with regulations can lead to legal consequences.\newline Security risks involve vulnerabilities that could allow malicious actors to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or disrupt services. Security breaches are important as well because they can cause severe harm to users and lead to financial loss due to operational losses. Without the proper security measures, malicious actors could disrupt your service, gain access to large amounts of user data, and use that to produce harm outside the scope of your software service.
\end{enumerate}
