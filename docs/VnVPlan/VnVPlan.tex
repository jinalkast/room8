This document provides the VnV plans for all relevant aspects of this project. These include the VnV plans for the SRS, system architecture, implementation, and requirements. In addition, this document outlines the expected software and tools to be used in the VnV and the expected roles/responsibilities of the project team. \\\\This document begins with a 
\hyperref[sec:generalInfo]{General Information Section} that acts as a primer to the project and contains all the background information needed to understand the document.\\\\Following the primer, \hyperref[section:JustPlan]{Section 3} outlines the VnV plans for project and is followed by \hyperref[section:systemTests]{System Tests} for all the requirements outlined in the SRS. In future revisions, a 5th section outlining detailed unit tests will be added to this document, but at the time of writing the detailed design had not been completed.

\section{General Information}
\label{sec:generalInfo}
\subsection{Summary}

Shared living environments often create tension between roommates. It can be inconvenient and sometimes awkward to explicitly reach out to a roommate about the messes they leave behind in a shared space, concerns over bill payments, household upkeep, and more. Our project, Room8,
aims to prevent these cumbersome interactions by providing an application and the
necessary hardware components to help monitor the cleanliness of shared spaces,
schedule tasks, track shared billing cycles, and alert roommates of any issues within the shared house.

\subsection{Objectives}


The objective for this document, and the VnV plan that it outlines, is to support the idea that all software built for the project is correct, complete, and provides a satisfying user experience. The reason why these qualities are emphasized are due to the fact that the outputs of our system have real-life implications (i.e. cleanliness detector determining the incorrect roommate made a mess, bill splitter incorrectly calculating amounts due, etc.), making correctness and completion essential. Additionally, since the application is very user-centric, the user experience is central to the project's success and must be treated as such. Since this will be the main focus of our testing efforts, there are certain elements of our project which will not be tested extensively by our own team. For example, any external libraries that will be used as a part of Room8 will be assumed to have rigorous verification and validation already completed by the implementation team who created it. Additionally, extreme scalability/load testing will not be completed as part of the initial VnV. This is due to the hypothetical nature of the project in its current state, which doesn't require the system to be able to withstand many concurrent users at a time. 

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}


The challenge level of our project is general. The extras that will be completed as part of this project include additional features related to student housing and user documentation. Since the main functionality of Room8 is the cleanliness detector and image processing is not a novel concept (mess detecting software already exists), the challenge level is not advanced. However, the program still presents a variety of difficulties on the implementation side, preventing it from being classified as basic. The extras include the user-facing software, which provides all of the other student housing features (i.e. bill splitter, scheduler, etc.), and a thorough guide for the application and installation of the hardware will be delivered upon the project's completion.  

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
The SRS will be referenced throughout the VnV process, as it contains all of the system requirements, which will be verified and validated through testing. Every requirement in the SRS will be referenced by one or more test(s) in this document to ensure that the system is functioning as expected and that everything required from the system is being completed.

\section{Plan}
\label{section:JustPlan}
The following section outlines the execution plan for verifying project documentation and validating the software. The sections begin outlining the verification and validation team. Following section 3.1, sections 3.2 and 3.4 outline the plans for verifying documentation, while sections 3.5-3.7 discuss verification and validation for the system.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

    \hline
    Mohammed Abed & Developer & Mohammed's role will be focused on automating test cases using online tools such as GitHub actions and any other tools the team chooses to use. Since Mohammed's strengths and past experiences are in web development, he will also provide support in developing tests for the user-facing application. \\
   	\hline
    Maged Armanios & Developer & Maged's role will focus on developing unit and usability tests for the user-facing application and its backend. These tests will be then automated by Mohammed using tools like GitHub Actions. \\
    \hline
    Jinal Kasturiarachchi & Developer & Jinal will verify the usability requirements for the system. In addition, due to the expected workload of each role being unknown at the time of writing, Jinal will support any other developer who has received a larger-than-average workload. \\
    \hline
    Jane Klavir & Developer & Jane's role will have her verify the cleanliness management system meets the requirements outlined. This includes that it'll be able to detect created messes, cleaned messes, and states of no change. \\
    \hline
    Harshil Patel & Developer & Harshil will focus on testing the safety and security of the system. This includes ensuring all data is stored securely, access tokens are confidential, and authorization is secure on the user's end.  \\
	\hline
	Dr. R Tharmarasa & Supervisor & Dr. Tharmarasa's role will be to provide the team with support in making decisions related to the cleanliness management algorithm. Additionally, Dr. Tharmarasa will provide his input on the feasibility of requirements related to the cleanliness management system using his research experience in classification and related topics.
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Note about project roles}: While each team member has specific roles, all members of the team are expected to be able to support each other when required. The roles defined in the table above are simply the optimal roles for each member based on their expertise and do not restrict the work they are able to undergo to only what's outlined in the table above.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
\label{section:SRSVerificationPlan}
To verify our SRS, the development team will meet with the project supervisor, dr. Tharmarasa. In this meeting, the group will present a summarized version of the SRS which outlines the components, functionality, constraints, and assumptions. This presentation will be accompanied by some form of presentation of the use-case scenarios outlined in the SRS. This can be done with either a low-fidelity mock-up or a live demo of the system if sufficient development has been completed. After the presentation, we will ask the supervisor whether they found any use cases unimportant and requirements unverifiable. After meeting with our supervisor, the team will redraft the requirements and use cases according to his feedback. \\\\
In the event we are unable to meet with our supervisor for review, an alternative approach would be to seek peer review and feedback from our primary project reviewers. The meeting would have a similar structure to that which, would be done with Dr. Tharmarasa. \\

Additionally, the development team will review the SRS document to verify each requirement:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is free of implementation details
\item Does not include acceptance criteria
\item Does not conflict with any other requirement
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
The system architecture will be verified by the development team in a formal meeting. The meeting will have each member read through the system architecture and verify it according to the following checklist:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each requirement and/or use case defined in the SRS, does the architecture enable the system to do so?
\item Is there no overlap between the modules (separation of concerns)?
\item Is the system easy to scale (consider both horizontal and vertical scaling)? If you were to scale the system, how would you do so?
\item Does the architecture include security measures to satisfy the non-functional requirements in the SRS?
\item Does the architecture support unit testing?
\item Does the architecture support the addition of new modules (extension)? 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}
The Verification and Validation Plan will be read by each member of the team to confirm the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each teammember referenced has clear, defined roles with a clause for role switching and overlapping roles
\item Each test satisfies the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The test corresponds to a requirement in the SRS
\item Functional requirements have test cases specific enough that a test can be built with the data. Including clearly defined inputs and outputs
\item Functional test cases are deterministic
\item Nonfunctional test cases are specific and provide enough information that someone can run the test once the product is built. 
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}




\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
The system implementation will be verified using a plethora of tools and techniques. First, the implementation of the system will be verified using the \hyperref[section:systemTests]{system tests} and \hyperref[section:unitTests]{unit tests} outlined in sections \hyperref[section:systemTests]{4} and 5 (5 is omitted until the detailed design is complete). Additionally, the development team will create integration tests to see if the interactions between different modules are expected. Any tests that can be used during CI/CD use will be done with them to ensure changes to the source code do not create a loss of functionality. Finally, the team will perform an acceptance test, running the application and acting out the key use-case scenarios outlined in the SRS.\\
\\
During development, the team will use static analysis tools to help minimize common development mistakes such as referencing non-existent variables, incorrect type operations, etc.\\
\\ Additional tests that can be executed if required are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Code walkthroughs with the development team
\item Review sessions with our team's primary reviewers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
\label{subsec:tools}
At the time of writing, the programming languages have not been finalized. Nonetheless, this section outlines the expected tools that will be utilized for the expected programming languages and frameworks. Currently, the expected programming languages and frameworks are expected to be JavaScript/TypeScript for the frontend application, utilizing the React framework, and Python for the cleanliness management system.
  
  \textbf{TypeScript}:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Jest: The preferred framework for testing React-based applications
   \item Puppeteer: Provides high-level APIs to control Chrome and allows for automating UI testing, form submissions, and keyboard inputs easily
   \item ESLint: A code linter that helps catch common programming mistakes and can be enhanced to enforce code styling. Automates the detection of potential vulnerabilities and life-cycle methods for React-based projects.
   \end{itemize}
   \textbf{Python}:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Pylance: A language server providing tools features like IntelliSense, logical linting, code actions, code navigation, and semantic colorization. These features can assist developers in catching errors while developing.
   \item Flake8: A command-line utility for enforcing style consistency across Python projects. Includes lint checks.
   \item Pytest and PyUnit: Testing frameworks.
   \end{itemize}
  \textbf{CI/CD Tools}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item GitHub Actions: Allows for the automation of builds and tests
  \end{itemize}
    \textbf{API Testing Tools}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Postman: Can run API functional and performance tests to determine average and median API response times. Postman can also be used to ensure the correctness of an API's response 
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}
In the \hyperref[section:SRSVerificationPlan]{SRS verification plan}, a meeting with the project supervisor, dr. Tharmarasa was mentioned, which had him review the use cases and requirements of the project. This session will also act as part of the software validation plan since Dr. Tharmarasa is independent of the development and project team. Additionally, feedback from primary reviewers and primary stakeholders (people living in shared living spaces) will be taken into consideration and possibly used to revise some requirements.    
\section{System Tests}
\label{section:systemTests}
This section outlines the tests that will be used to verify and validate that Room8 is meeting its requirements. \hyperref[subsec:testsForFunc]{4.1} and \hyperref[subsec:testsForNonFunc]{4.2} designate tests for functional and nonfunctional requirements respectively, and tests are furthermore split into Room8's various modules for ease of readability and traceability. The output section of each test case describes the pass condition, thus this is the criteria the app developers will use to confirm that the app aligns with requirements. 

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
\label{subsec:testsForFunc}
Functional requirements pertain to the core functionality of the app. Room8 has the core functionality of registering users into a home, deploying a ChatBot for notifications, establishing a cleanliness managegement system, providing an event scheduler, and implementing a bill-splitter. The following tests will provide evidence of these integral components being successfully fulfilled.

\subsubsection{User Authentication and House Management}
When a group of students chooses to adopt Room8 to help with their house, the first step is to register all the members and connect them into a common home group through the app. The tests in this section realize this fundamental first step, and are in conjunction with requirements FR211-FR218.

\section{Appendix}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}


The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
Answers:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item While writing this deliverable, the team was able to start much earlier and each individual member of the team took more initiative. This lead to the deliverable being close to completion much earlier (relative to the deadline) than other deliverables for the project. Additionally, we had planned some questions before our meeting with our TA which when answered gave us a lot of clarity about this deliverable so we were able to  work with less confusion. Finally, the work items for this deliverable were separated very fairly, with the core sections of this deliverable having multiple people working on them and other sections being delegated to a single person.
  \item There were not any major pain points in this deliverable. Some minor pain points that did occur include some confusions about what do with section 3.3 and section 5, as they relate to the design document which at the time of writing, has not been completed. Another minor paint point was that the this document required the SRS to be modified in situtations which we discovered new requirements and since our SRS, this was cumbersome and difficult to coordinate for the multiple group members developing test cases who may have done duplicate work. To deal with this, we created a thread in our group chat on discord where we notified each other when modifications were being done to the SRS.
  \item The team will need to learn how to use various tools and testing libraries to complete the verification of the project. Some of these tools and libraries include the automation of tests on GitHub Actions, testing libraries for specific programming languages (Pytest, Jest, etc), and Postman. In addition to just tools and libraries, the team will also need to learn and improve their analytical skills for software. This project involves a lot of analysis on all aspects of it such as requirements, code, and use cases. Learning and improving the teams code review / walkthrough skills, to effectively evaluate / communicate what the code would / should do is essential.
  \item For learning a new testing tool or library, our team has decided to rely on the countless resources available on the internet, as well as an opportunity for transferable knowledge. Applying these methods will help with integrating automated testing into our software effectively.\\
  One approach for mastering a new tool or library is to follow a tutorial or short course readily available online, for instance this \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ}{Intro to Postman} Youtube series or this \href{https://www.linkedin.com/learning/unit-testing-in-python}{Unit Testing in Python} course from LinkedIn Learning. Maged Armanios will use this approach because by following a tutorial created by an expert, he can understand important nuances of the software. In addition, he enjoys following tutorials and learns well when doing a guided lesson.\\
  Another approach is to create a small, simple project for unit testing and using the documentation/reference material from the library chosen, integrate the tool on a small scale and keep increasing the coverage until it is adequate for the entire project. For our project, we will use the proof of concept (POC) as our basic starting point to add test automation, and then expand into other modules as we gain familiarity with the chosen tool. Harshil Patel will lead this effort because he has experience working in software testing and test automation. Harshil's foundation in congruent skills gives him confidence that he can successfully integrate a testing library with just the distributor’s reference material.\\
  Improving software analytical skills will really improve the functionality of the software and ensure the code is concise, optimal, and scalable/maintainable. There are countless approaches to developing these skills but we believe the ones identified below are most applicable to our project.\\
  The first approach would be to gather all the diagrams from all our documentation, and create more as necessary to really harbour the understanding of exactly how the code will be used and how functions will be fulfilled. Such diagrams include case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and flow charts. This is delegated to Zayn Abed because Zayn is strong with organization and attention-to-detail. He will be able to lay out the flow and functionality of the app and ensure there are no gaps.\\
  The second approach expands on the first one, and it is to use the findings to draw common themes and create a software architecture that incorporates design patterns to accomplish the purpose of each module. Material from previous courses will be used to aid in ultimately creating a UML diagram that encapsulates our software. Using design patterns and principles will ensure scalability, reusability, modularity, testability, and more qualities of good design. Jane Klavir will follow this approach because Jane is passionate about design and bringing together individual parts to make a cohesive whole.\\
  A third approach is to conduct code walkthroughs for our supervisor, Dr. Tharmarasa, as new elements are implemented. While these walkthroughs do not have to be perfect or formal, they should clearly get the point across to our supervisor so that he can analyse the software effectively and provide his expert evaluation. Jinal Kasturiarachchi will be responsible for doing walkthroughs in meetings with Dr. Tharmarasa because Jinal enjoys presenting and opening the discussion for team to furthermore receive valuable feedback.  \\
\end{enumerate}
