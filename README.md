Developer Names: Mohammed Abed, Maged Armanios, Jinal Kasturiarachchi, Jane Klavir, Harshil Patel

Date of project start: September 24, 2024

Roommates often complain about cleanliness of communal spaces and have a difficult time holding each other accountable. Shared living spaces often cause friction in communicating expectations and frustrations. This application uses computer vision to detect the cleanliness of indoor environments, quantify who is creating/cleaning messes, and relay that information to occupants. It essentially serves as a mediator for student houses.
